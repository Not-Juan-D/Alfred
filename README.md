# Alfred

## Design Brief & Iterations

The initial brief was a task and time managing solution for South Korean high school students preparing for the Korean CSAT.

To further enhance their experience, the following sub-functions were planned aside from the usual planner(task manager) function;

Interactive Covey Quadrant

Stopwatch

Break Time Tracker

Reference List Creator

Music Player

After some self-evaluation and iteration, the web app prototype seen here contains the following features;

~~Interactive Covey Quadrant~~ -> Static Covey Quadrant

Stopwatch (As planned)

~~Break Time Tracker~~ -> Pomodoro Timer

~~Reference List Creator~~ -> Dictionary(Wikipedia) Lookup Page

~~Music Player~~ -> ***Removed***



### Music Player 

I have decided not to include a music player in my web-app prototype based on user and technical research.

To justify, I went back to my 20 context research participants and asked them whether they would be eager use an embedded music player rather than the services they were currently using.

No one gave a definitive(positive) answer, mainly because they're already used to their preferred services or apps, and they would have to 'redesign' everything if they decided to move to an embedded player. Here are some quotes from users;


*"I already pay to use certain apps and services. I won't be giving up those premium features to use a service which I don't even know well."*

*"I would have to migrate everything - including playlists and preferences. So no."*


Furthermore, the players itself might function as a distraction to my potential users.

My target users are students preparing for the Korean CSAT, which requires insane levels of concentration even when you're studying for it. 

So a huge number of students choose to 'downgrade' their smart devices to those with less functions, or even to ones which are not 'smart' at all. 

You can easily find mobile service providers advertising their so-called 'student phones', which are basically pagers rather than smartphones. 

This is also why I designed Alfred's UI to be rather vague and dull - to eliminate any chances of being distracted while providing all necessary functions to my users. 

If I decide to add a fully operational online music player to my web app, my users are likely to see this as another possible source of distraction and eventually choose not to use Alfred as their task and time managing solution.


And even if the user is favorable of listening to music while studying, switching between apps and windows are just two swipes or presses away. 

Iphones for example, we can just swap the screen to access your favourite service. If you're on PC, just tab out and tab in. It's really not that hard.

Why would someone give up the service they were enjoying so much that they sometimes wouldn't even bother paying for a premium subscription, when you can rather choose to just 'swap' between apps and windows?


~~(Sorry for the aggressive writing style, I tried to write it like a development brief to my client, as I read from a Slack post saying it's basicially telling them they're wrong, which in this case they are)~~
